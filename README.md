# 2D Snake Game

Welcome to the 2D Snake Game! This classic arcade game has been implemented in Java for your enjoyment. Control the snake, eat food, and grow longer without running into yourself or hitting the walls!

## How to Play

- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).
- **Objective**: Guide the snake to eat the food represented by a dot ('‚óè'). Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Experience the nostalgia of the classic Snake game with modern Java implementation.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging. Can you handle the increasing speed and length of the snake?
- **High Score**: Challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can without crashing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java installed.
3. Compile the Java files using `javac *.java`.
4. Run the game using `java SnakeGame`.
